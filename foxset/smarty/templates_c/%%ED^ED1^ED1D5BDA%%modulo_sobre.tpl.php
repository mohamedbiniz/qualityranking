	FoxSet was developed as an Information Retrieval (IR) course project. The course is taught by Prof. Geraldo Xexéo, at PESC/COPPE/UFRJ (Systems Engineering and Computer Science Program - Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute for Graduate Studies and Research in Engineering - Federal University of Rio de Janeiro).

	IR and other disciplines need web-based datasets for experiments. Adequate datasets are not easily found and can be very expensive. At the same time, there is a lack of dataset building tools and a huge amount of opportunities to build such tools, considering the technologies available.

	FoxSet was conceived as a course project, but also as a real tool to assist in dataset building and management.
